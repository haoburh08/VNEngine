## Usage

Creating a visual novel with VNEngine is simple. Hereâ€™s a basic example to get you started.

### Create a JSON Script

Define your story in a JSON file. Hereâ€™s a sample structure:

```json
{
  "title": "My First Visual Novel",
  "scenes": [
    {
      "id": "scene1",
      "text": "Welcome to my visual novel!",
      "choices": [
        {
          "text": "Start the adventure",
          "nextScene": "scene2"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "scene2",
      "text": "You are now in the second scene.",
      "choices": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### Load the Script

In your main application file, load the JSON script:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { VNEngine } from 'vn-engine';
import script from './path/to/your/script.json';

const App = () => {
  return <VNEngine script={script} />;
};

export default App;
```

### Run Your Visual Novel

With the JSON script in place and the engine loaded, you can now run your visual novel. Use the development server to see your creation in action.

## Project Structure

Understanding the project structure is essential for effective development. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

```
VNEngine/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ App.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- **public/**: Contains the HTML file and static assets.
- **src/**: The main source folder where your components and styles reside.
- **components/**: Reusable components for your visual novel.
- **assets/**: Images, sounds, and other media files.
- **styles/**: CSS files for styling your application.

## Customization

VNEngine allows for extensive customization. You can modify the styles, add new components, and even extend the functionality of the engine.

### Styling

To customize the look and feel of your visual novel, modify the CSS files in the `styles/` directory. You can create themes or use pre-built CSS frameworks to enhance your UI.

### Adding Components

You can create new components in the `components/` directory. For example, if you want to add a character sprite component, create a new file named `CharacterSprite.js` and define your component there.
